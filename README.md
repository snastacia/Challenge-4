# User Story

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

# Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock

## Description

Created an application using Web APIs to quiz myself as a future developer on JavaScript. The quiz is timed, 60 seconds in length, contains 4 questions and deducts 10 seconds from the timer whenever you get  question wrong. Once the quiz is complete, you can enter your intials and save your score. You can then view highscores in the 'High Scores' section. 


## Installation

No installation required.
